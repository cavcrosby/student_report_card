# student_report_card

# Brief

**student_report_card** is a terminal based application, used to write and manage record files (which do contain grades) of students.

## Building

1. CMake (https://cmake.org/) (v. 3.3.14) text is provided to construct makefile(s). Feel free to use the generator (build system) of your choice.

## Description

This terminal application would be geared towards teachers/administrators of students' records. Student records contain students' grades in Physics, Chemistry, Math, English, and Biology along with a record number that uniquely identifies a student. These records can be printed out as report cards to the terminal, records can also be modified and deleted.

## Future Features Ideas
For each record created, that is not deleted before the program terminates, could be stored as a text file in a directory. When the user reopens the application, the application will be able to load the existing text files for the user to display.
