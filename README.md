# student_report_card

**student_report_card** is a terminal based application, used to write and manage record files (which do contain grades) of students.

# Building

1. CMake (https://cmake.org/)
2. With the project being small in scope. Any build tool can be used, I will write if otherwise.

## Usage/Description

This terminal application would be geared towards teachers/administrators of students' records. I envision that for each record created, a new text file will also be generated in another directory once the program finishes storing the object's data. When that individual re-opens the program, every text-file is read and stored into a data-structure so the individual using the application is aware of all the records that exist.

*(**This may change as progress on the project continues**)*
